Literature
=============
An Implementation of the Card Game.

- Uses Python 3 for everything.
- Game and players are written as classes.

### File Notes
- The primary game file is literature.py.
- That's the only program file included.

### Implementation
- See implementation.txt to write your own players.
- The code to run the sim shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
